This is an compilation of all the icons I've made, along with some resource items I had sitting around.

VERSION 2.0

Now included, code for Super Events and Pax's Custom Achievement System. 
The code should be self explanatory for people familiar with scripted GUI or arrays.

NOTE:
- Unless the icon is using a frame I made specifically, I'm not claiming the frames are my work.

- The resources are from either IRL stuff, EU4 or HOI4 (obviously), use at your discretion.

Otherwise go nuts. I'm not pretentious enough to demand credit or some shit.
